## Module 15 Challenge Leaflet

In this challenge, I used data from United States Geological Survey (USGS) to develop a visualization with earthquake data (Magnitude 1.0+ Earthquakes in the Past 7 Days). In order to create this visualization, I used HTML/CSS and JavaScript (D3 and Leaflet library). In part 1, I created a map with markers that pinpoint the locations of earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 1.0 in the past 7 days. The size of the marker correlates with the magnitude of the earthquake, and the color of the marker correlates with the depth of the earthquake. I also developed a popup feature, which provides additional earthquake information when a marker is clicked upon. Additionally, I added a legend to the map. In part 2, I used another dataset to visualize tectonic plates on the map. After completing both parts, I noticed that a lot of earthquakes tend to fall along the tectonic plates.
